# 3D  Cube Room
## Description
A very simple HTML/CSS (with a tiny bit of JS) project to create a 3D room to run simple training scenarios and provide a nicer 3D experience without the typical overhead of a real 3D project.

## Languages/Scripts
Very Vanilla, HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of JS to handle input events.

## Structure
Standard index.html file with style and script files. And an img folder that contains textures for walls, etc. If you keep the image sizes and names the same, you can swap out whatever is in there.
